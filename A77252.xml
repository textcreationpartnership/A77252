         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

That God blinds and hardens wicked men, not by changing them from better to worſe, but onely, by not changing them from worſe to better.</hi> He doth not harden them by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſing or inferring any wicked quality into them, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore was not in them; but by not infuſing nor infering better qualities into them, than by nature they have in them; thus men are ſaid to blind one another. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 20.2. <hi>Behold, my Father will doe nothing, either great or ſmall, but that he will ſhew it me, and why ſhould my Father hide this thing from me.</hi> Where he ſhewes that his Fathers hideing that thing from him (if he did it) would be by not ſhewing it unto him, and not by blinding of him, or by infuſing of any dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe into him, or by taking any light or underſtanding from
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:160531:4"/>him; even ſo God hides things from men, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 4.27. <hi>The Lord hath hid it from me, and hath not told me.</hi> Where it is clear, that the Lord hid that thing from him by not tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling it unto him, and not by blinding of him more than he was before; not by taking any knowledge from him, that he had, but by not giving more knowledge to him than he had. And <hi>Gen.</hi> 18.17. <hi>And the Lord ſaid, ſhall I hide from Abraham that thing which I doe.</hi> Which is as much as to ſay, ſhall I not reveale to <hi>Abraham</hi> that thing which I doe, or I will reveale to <hi>Abraham</hi> that thing which I do.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reaſ.</hi> Firſt, It muſt needs be ſo, becauſe blindneſſe or ignorance of Chriſt, and hardneſſe of heart againſt him, is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill and ſin; Now God hath no evill, nor can be the author of evill, and therefore he cannot hide any good from men by inſuſing any evill into them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reaſ.</hi> Secondly, Becauſe (as he cannot be the Author of any evill, becauſe it is evill, ſo) he cannot be an infuſer of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill into one that is either good or evill already, becauſe that is evill alſo; Wherefore as ignorance of Chriſt, and hardnſſe of heart againſt Chriſt are evill, and as God hath no evill nor cannot be the Author nor Actor of evill; it muſt needs be, that his hiding of Chriſt and the things of him from men, is not by taking any light or ſight from them: but onely by his not communicating his light to them; thus onely God hides the things of Chriſt from the wiſe and prudent.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vſe.</hi> This therefore (according to what I conceive) ſhewes clearly, that no naturall man hath free will or power in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to believe in Chriſt to ſalvation and glory. <hi>Ier.</hi> 10.23. and 13.23.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> And whereas it is objected againſt this, thus, <hi>Adam,</hi> and all his poſterity in his loynes had free will to good, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he loſt it by ſinne in his fall: but Chriſt the ſecond <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> came to (and did) reſtore to the firſt <hi>Adam,</hi> and to all his poſterity all that they have loſt. <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.14.—19. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all <hi>Adams</hi> poſterity, which are all men, have free will to good and to believe to ſalvation and glory.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Firſt, I deny that <hi>Adam,</hi> or his poſterity in him had ever free will to believe to ſalvation and glory.</p>
            <pb n="6" facs="tcp:160531:5"/>
            <p> Firſt, Becauſe as <hi>Adam</hi> and his poſterity in him, in their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency before their fall had no need of a Saviour, or of faith to believe in one to ſalvation, ſo neither had they free will ſo to believe; for as they had by nature ſo much as they needed, ſo they had no more then they needed.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Becauſe <hi>Adam</hi> in innocency was but a meere na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall man, whoſe holineſſe was but a naturall holyneſſe, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting onely of an innocency of all evill, whereas faith in Chriſt is a grace of the holy Spirit of God; <hi>Gal</hi> 5.22. and the Divine nature of God. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.4. Therefore <hi>Acam</hi> in his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency had not Faith, nor power to believe as aforeſaid; Wherefore though Chriſt reſtores againe all that <hi>Adam</hi> loſt, yet he reſtores not to him nor to his; a power to beleeve in Chriſt to ſalvation by nature; becauſe by nature they never had it, nor loſt it.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Becauſe if <hi>Adam,</hi> and his poſterity in him, in their innocency had this power and grace of Faith, then could not <hi>Adam</hi> and his poſterity have fell from God as they did; as no man now that hath received that grace, or any grace in truth can fall totally and finally from God; this ſhall ſuffice for the firſt anſwer to the queſtion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Secondly, ſuppoſe that it were granted that <hi>Adam</hi> in his innocency had free will to believe as aforeſaid and that he loſt it in his fall, and that Chriſt came to reſtore it to him againe, and that Chriſt hath done what he came to doe; yet he hath no more reſtored this free will, or power of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving to <hi>Adam</hi> and his poſterity as yet, then he hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed death, and all the occaſions thereof; to wit, imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of body, weakneſſe, ſickneſſe, exceſſive cold, and heate, and all other evils that are incident to the nature and condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of man in this world, which <hi>Adam</hi> with the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>oſſe of free will as aforeſaid (which I deny that ever he had it by nature to looſe) procured by his fall.</p>
            <p>Now I grant that whatſoever <hi>Adam</hi> loſt, or procured by his fall, Chriſt the ſecond <hi>Adam</hi> by his death will reſtore, and all things elſe to their firſt and beſt condition; in which ſenſe the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> is called the figure of him that was to come, to wit, Chriſt. <hi>Rom</hi> 5.14. But I affirme that this reſtauration in
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:160531:5"/>reſpect of us is not yet, but as the harveſt is potentially in the ſeed: <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.11, 12. So this generall reſtauration is potentially in the death &amp; reſurrection of Chriſt, or in the redemption by Chriſt, according to <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.8, 9. <hi>thou haſt put all things in ſubject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion under his feat;</hi> For in that he put all in ſubjection under him, he left nothing that is not put under him: but now we ſee not yet all things put under him; but we ſee Jeſus, who was made a little lower then the Angels, for, or by the ſuffering of death, crowned with glory and honour, that he by the grace of God ſhould taſt death for every man; Where the Apoſtle ſheweth, that in regard of us men, and of time, this redemption or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtauration by Chriſt is not, but in regard of the work it ſelf (which appeares in Chriſts victory over his and our enemies, and his exaltation into glory) this generall redemption and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtauration is already, though we ſee not yet all things put un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him, yet we ſee Jeſus by the ſuffering of death crowned with glory and honour, we ſee that he hath overcome, and hath obtained the honourable garland, and glorious crown of victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry over al his and our enemies, ſo as they can never prevaile nor perſiſt long againſt us; the time will come when all their power will be over, and all things reſtored againe according to the worth and dignity of the death of Chriſt, the time thereof is at hand, but it is not yet; and therefore it is ſaid to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected or waited for by the Saints themſelves. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.23. <hi>We our ſelves greane within our ſelves waiting for the adoption</hi> to wit, <hi>the redemption of our body.</hi> Eph. 4.30. <hi>Grieve not the holy Spirit of God, whereby we are ſealed unto the day of redemption.</hi> So that though redemption is already in regard of God and the work it ſelfe, yet, it is not yet in regard of men, and of time; but it is to come, and will be to come untill Chriſt our reedemer come againe; Therefore he ſaith, (<hi>Luk.</hi> 21.27.28.) after he had declared to his people the ſignes of his ſecond com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>And then ſhall they ſee the Sonne of man coming in a Cloud with Power and great glory. And when theſe things begin to come to paſſe, then looke up, and lift up your heads, for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption draweth nigh,</hi> and hence it is ſaid, <hi>Act.</hi> 3.20, 21. <hi>And he ſhall ſend Jeſus Chriſt, which before was preached unto you, whom the heaven muſt receive, untill the times of reſtaura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:160531:6"/>of all things.</hi> So that the work of redemption though it be compleated in regard of it ſelfe, yet in regard of time it is not, neither is the reſtauration or reſtitution of all things, or of any thing untill the ſecond comming of Chriſt from heaven; Wherefore if it were granted that <hi>Adam</hi> by his fall loſt free will to believe in Chriſt to ſalvation and glory, (which I deny) and Chriſt by his death hath reſtored it to <hi>Adam</hi> and his poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity againe; yet it would be but potentially as the harveſt is in the ſeede. <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.11, 12.</p>
            <p>Sect. 6. <hi>I thanke thee, becauſe thou haſt hid theſe things.</hi> whence Obſerve,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Doct. That thanks ought to be given to God for any worke or effect of his works or word good or evill in men.</hi> 2 Gor. 2.14, 15. Leive. 10.1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vſe.</hi> I thank God for making me or any man an inſtrument of his glory in any kind, either of his mercy, or of his juſtice; I do not thank God for the hardening and ruining of any man or woman, but for the manifeſtation and glorification of his juſtice; Neither do I thanke God for glorifying of his juſtice, in the hardening &amp; deſtroying of any enemy of his: but I thank him for the glorifying of his juſtice, though in the hardning and deſtruction of any enemy of his; For Gods will is that we ſhould labour to bring our will to all his will, or wills, and ſo farr as we come ſhort of this, we are weake and imperfect in grace; For when we are juſt men made perfect, we ſhall with joy thanke God aſwell for the glory of his juſtice though it be in the damnation of our parents, or children, &amp;c. as for the glory of his mercy in the ſalvation of our Parents or children, or of our ſelves. &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Sect. 7. <hi>Thou haſt hid theſe things from the wiſe and prudent,</hi> that is, both from the wiſdom and prudence of this world, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.21. <hi>In the wiſdom of God, the world by wiſdom knew not God.</hi> Matt. 16.16, 17. <hi>fleſh and bloud hath not revealed is unto the,</hi> and for the moſt part of the wiſe and prudent of the world: Ye ſee your calling brethren, how that not many wiſe men af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the fleſh — are called, ſome of them are called, but yet they are but few to them of that ſort that are not called; from hence we may obſerve this truth,</p>
            <pb n="9" facs="tcp:160531:6"/>
            <p> 
               <hi>Doct. That all worldly wiſdom and prudence, is ſo farre from attaining the knowledge of Chriſt, that in anaturall man (above all things) it obſcures and hides Chriſt from him, and hinders him from Chriſt, its the greateſt impediment in a naturall man in his way to the knowledge of Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And for the better clearing of this point, I will ſhew what humain wiſdom is, and what humain prudence is, and in what ſenſe they are diſtinct, and to be known one from the other. Human wiſdom is naturall knowledge, and human prudence is knowledge of nature; Wiſdom is a ſeed of Prudence in nature, and prudence is the knowledge of nature as the fruit and effect of wiſdom: ſo that prudence is ſomething acquired by the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall ſeed of wiſdom in the uſe of means, and ſo prudence here is nothingelſe but their ſcience or knowledg of the humane arts attained by ſtudy, and practiſe in the improvement of the ſeede naturall wiſdom. Wiſdom is in nature prudence, and prudence is in nature wiſdom: inſomuch as wiſdom is perfectly in pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and prudence is potentially in wiſdom, as the harveſt is in the ſeed, as heathen teachers and writers (the greateſt na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turalliſts and ſeacrhers into nature) have obſerved, <hi>Plato</hi> affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, that there is ſet in the ſoul of man coming into the world, certain ſpecies, or as it were ſeed of things, and rules of Arts or ſciences; Wherefore <hi>Socrates</hi> (in the books of ſcience) reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleth himſelf to a Midwiſe, his words are theſe, In teaching young men, I did put into them no ſcience, but rather brought forth that which already was in them: like as the Midwiſe brought not in the child, but being conceived did help to bring it forth. Thus having ſhewed you the nature of imman wiſdom and Prudence, and how they differ, I will now ſhew you the danger of them in a naturall man, as being the greateſt obſtacle in the way to the divine knowledge of Chriſt, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 47.10. The wiſdom and thy knowledge hath perverted the. <hi>Hebr.</hi> hath cauſed the to turn away. <hi>I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">

            <p>King <hi>Iames</hi> (a profound Scholler) did experimentally ſee, and ſay, that the deepe Theoremes or knowledge of Philoſophy makes one learned, but ſeldome better, and oftentimes worſe, meere Athiſts, wiſe men after the fleſh are too wiſe
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:160531:7"/>to goe to Heaven, and the Reaſons of this Truth are,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reaſ.</hi> Firſt, Becauſe humane wiſdom and prudence are in, and of nature, now all the nature of man is corrupted, and at enmity againſt God, Nay the carnall minde is enmity it ſelfe againſt God, (inſomuch as) it is (not onely) not ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to the Law of God, (but alſo it) neither indeede can be. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.7. The naturall man perceiveth not the things of the ſpirit of God, for they are fooliſhnes unto him, neither can he know them, becauſe they are ſpiritually diſcerned. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.14. So then they that are in the fleſh, cannot pleaſe God. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.8. Therefore all naturall wiſdom, and prudence in naturall things in a naturall man, are ſo far from attaining the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Chriſt, that it hides Chriſt from him, and hinders him from Chriſt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reaſ.</hi> Secondly, Becauſe fleſhly, wiſdom and prudence, makes men arrogant and proud, and lifts them up above, and againſt the croſſe of Chriſt, the humility and poverty &amp;c, of Chriſt; knowledge puffeth up, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.1. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.6. But he that will come to Chriſt muſt deny himſelf, and take up his croſſe, and follow him. <hi>Matt.</hi> 16.24. <hi>Ergo. &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reaſ.</hi> Thirdly, Humane wiſdom and prudence in a naturall man obſcures, and hinders him of the knowledge of Chriſt, becauſe it cannot acquire, not in the leaſt meaſure be a mears to him to procure it in the leaſt meaſure, it hinders becauſe it conduceth nothing unto this ſupernatural knowledge; <hi>He that is not with me is againſt me; and he that gathereth not with me, ſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereth abroad,</hi> ſaith Chriſt <hi>Mat.</hi> 12.30.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 4. Becauſe only by Faith men are able to apprehend and underſtand Chriſt, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.6. Now fleſhly wiſdom, and humane prudence in a naturall man, hinders him from Faith, for humane wiſdom, and prudence will beleeve no more in Religion, then is plain and demonſtrative by reaſon, (and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it may be ſaid, there is nothing true in Religion, or Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity, that is either falſe in reaſon, or contrary to reaſon; yet, I ſay, there are many things in Religion, and Divinity, that are above reaſons reach, and that are to be believed by Faith, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they cannot be apprehended, or comprehended, much leſs demonſtrated by reaſon) now the naturall wiſe man will
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:160531:7"/>beleeve no more then he can take up by natural reaſon, although it be taught and confirmed by the word of God, as every ages experience from the beginning to this day have declared; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore fleſhly wiſdom, and humane prudence in a natural man, hides Chriſt from him, and hinders him from Chriſt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 5. Becauſe fleſhly wiſdom, and humane Learning makes men undocible of ſpiritual things; thoſe who are great Scholers in humane Learning, are aſhamed to be taught Divine Leſſons. They judge it to be as great diſgrace to them, as a boy that is well learned would be aſhamed to be put back by his maſter to learn his <hi>A B C</hi> again. Mt. <hi>Bolton</hi> who was a man of very pregnant wit, and a great Scholar, and a Batchelor of Divinity, acknowledged (as we may read in the relation of his life and death) that before his converſion, he accounted all Divinity, but foolery (which he repented of, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his converſion, acknowledging all wiſdom and learning to be but foolery; but the wiſdom and learning of Divinity) wherefore all natural, and Scholaſticall wiſdom in a naturall man hides Chriſt from him, and hinders him from Chriſt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 6. Becauſe in Scholars that are natural, there is a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain curioſity of diſputing, and propounding doubts and Queſtions; now though this may be commend able in humane Learning, yet it is condemnable in Divine: For it is written, <hi>I will deſtroy the wiſdom of the wiſe, and will bring to nothing the underſtanding of the prudent;</hi> Where is the wiſe? Where is the Scribe? Where is the Diſputer of this world? hath not God made ſooliſh the wiſdom of this world? for af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that, in the wiſdom of God, the world by wiſdom knew not God: <hi>It pleaſed God by the fooliſhneſs of preaching to ſave them that beleeve,</hi> 1 Cor. 1.19, 20.21. <hi>And I, brethren, when I came, to you, I came not with excellency of ſpeech, or of wiſdom, declaring unto you the wiſdom of God; for I determined not to know any thing among you, ſave Ieſus Chriſt, and him crucifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and my ſpeech, and my preaching was not with entiſing words of man<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="12" facs="tcp:160531:8"/>clear, that humane learning, quaint, and elegant words of mans wiſdom, are ſo far from being commended, that it is condemned in Divinity, and there is great reaſon rendered for it, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.5. <hi>That your Faith ſhould not stand in the Wiſdam of men, but in the power of God;</hi> and another main reaſon to the ſame effect, we finde in the 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.17. <hi>Chriſt ſent me to preach the Goſpel, not with wiſdom of words, leſt the croſſe of Chriſt ſhould be made of none effect.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now this is a great impediment in the way to Chriſt, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcuring Chriſt from the wiſe and prudent of the world, and hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders them mightily and mainly from embracing Chriſt, for wiſe men after the fleſh deſpiſe the ſimplicity of the Goſpel of Chriſt; <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> that great learned Philoſopher, rejected the <hi>Pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tateuch,</hi> or five Books of <hi>Moſes,</hi> becauſe he did onely poſitive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly lay down things, and not demonſtrate them from the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of Philoſophy, which is a main cauſe, why moſt men do refuſe to hear and receive the truth to this day.</p>
            <p>Some will not hear learned men, becauſe they preach not learnedly, in quaint, and elegant words of mans wiſdom; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers wil not hear unlearned men, becauſe they are not learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and ſo their humane-Wiſdom, and prudence prevents their whole mans eternal happineſs, and procures their everlaſting miſery.</p>

               <hi>Vſe</hi> 1. Shewing, that humane-Learning without Divine Religion is dangerous to the ſoul, and mightily indangers the ſoul; the ſtronger a man is, in his limbs, the abler he is to oppoſe, and prevent his Antagoniſt, ſo the greater the humble parts of an natural man are, the abler he is to oppoſe Chriſt, and to withſtand him in his word, &amp; in the motions of his ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit; his fleſhly wiſdom, and humane learning is his power and policy againſt Chriſt, which he will improve to the utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt againſt the truth and himſelf, as we ſee by ſad experience, for how fearfully, and diviliſhly do ſuch unlearned learned men, wreſt, wrinch, and pervert the Scriptures to their own deſtruction, as ſaint <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith in his ſecond Epiſtle <hi>chap.</hi> 3. <hi>ver.</hi> 16. which unlearned, and ignorant men have not skill to do, and therefore <hi>Paul</hi> doth moſt earneſtly exhort <hi>Timothy</hi> to avoid ſuch humane skill in Divine things, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.20, 21. <hi>O

If the light that is in thee be darkneſſe, to ſhew that the naturall and humane light of knowledge or ſcience in a man, if it be unſanctified, it is but the darkneſſe of ignorance, and is falſly called ſcience, or light, which ſome profeſſing have erred concerning the ſaith, now an errour you know is a taking up of ſomthing more or leſſe for truth that is not truth, and ſo as ſcience, knowledge, or light in a man unſanctified, is but ignorance or darknſſe, ſo it makes him to refuſe the light of truth for the darkneſſe of errour, and to rective the darkneſſe of error for the light of truth, hence the Prophet ſaith of thoſe that are in a wofull or naturall condition, that they ſay conceining evill, it is good, and concerning good, it is evill (as the Hebrew ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders it) that put darkneſſe for light, and light for darkneſſe, that put bitter for ſweet, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

<pb n="16" facs="tcp:160531:10"/>him from Chriſt, then it informes us, that you that are as yet a meere naturall or carnall man, and art unlearned and weake in underſtanding, that there is more poſſibility and probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of thy converſion, and glorious Salvation; then there is of a naturall carnall man that is endowed with much humane learning, and have abundance of wiſdome after the fleſh, as for example, ſuppoſe there were of learned wiſe men after the fleſh, and of unlearned men, weake in underſtanding, ſo many for ſo many, and all unconverted to Chriſt, as thus, grant that of each ſort of theſe there were an hundred, and of thoſe that are wiſe or learned men after the fleſh, there were but one onely to be ſaved, and that one as yet unknowne to any, or to himſelfe, and of the other ſort, to wit, the unlearned and ignorant ten to be ſaved, and they alſo unknowne as before, now he that is one of the laſt and ignoranteſt company, is not there more poſſibility and probability, and hope of his converſion, of any one of the other company of learned wiſe ones after the fleſh, yea there is ten to one more hopes of him then of any one of the other, for among an equall number of each ſort, many are called to Chriſt from among the ignorant or weake ſort of ſinners, and but a few from the more wiſe and learned ſort of ſinners, ſaith the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.26. for you know your calling Brethren, how that not many wiſe men after the fleſh—are called; wherefore where there are together a learned wiſe man after the fleſh, and an unlearned man, or one weake in underſtanding (I ſay not void of under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding) and both unconverted, the weaker or ignoranter ſinner is more like to be a ſinner then the other, and I my ſelfe being converted to Chriſt, ſeeing ſuch a couple of uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted ſinners together, and I might and muſt chuſe to be in the caſe of one of them, I profeſſe before God, that I would chuſe rather to be the ignorant or unlearned ſinner, then to be the wiſe or learned one; wherefore let ignorant and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned ſinners, learne both from Scripture and reaſon not to grudge at the fleſhly wiſdome and learning of others, nor diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paire for their own weakneſſe, and illiterateneſſe, and let not the learned, wiſe, unconverted men after the fleſh, diſdaine,

Seeing that naturall wiſdom and humane pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence or learning in a naturall man, is ſo farre from attaining the knowledge and divine learning of Chriſt, that it hides Chriſt from him, and hinders him from Chriſt, then art thou a learned or wiſe man after the fleſh, as <hi>Paul</hi> was, and hath Chriſt revealed himſelf to thee, and converted thee to himſelf as he did <hi>Paul,</hi> then behold in this ſimilitude Gods mercy to thy ſoule more then to other converts that are ignorant and illiterate in compariſon of thee, ſuppoſe there were 10. Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, and thy ſelfe one of them juſtly condemned to dye, and of theſe 10. the Kings pleaſure is to ſave 3. and of which 3. thou art one, yet unknown to thee, or any one of the 10. which are the 3. to be ſaved; now this is great mercy of the King to the whole 10. and ſo to thee as much as to any other of them, and ſo it will be apprehended by all, and each of them; but when thou comeſt to know that thou art one of the 3, to be ſaved, then thou wilt ſee greater mercy to thee, but if the King will ſave but 2. of theſe 10. condemned Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, and thou art one of theſe 2. then the Kings mercy is greater to thee, then if he had ſaved 3. and thee one of them, but if of theſe 10. the King will ſave but one, and thou art this one, then it would be greater mercy to thee then if thou hadſt been one of 2. or of 3. out of 10. to be ſaved, or thus, if there were 10. Traytors condemned to dye, and thou one of them, and the King will ſave 8. or 9. of them; now neither of theſe 8. or 9. could apprehend ſo much mercy of the King in his pardon, as he could if he were the one, or one of 2. of 10. Traytors condemned to dye; whereof there is but one, or two to be ſaved by the Kings mercy, and the other 8. or 9. to be put to death by the Kings juſtice, even ſo there are 2. ſorts of loſt people, and of each ſort God will ſave ſome, now of thoſe 2. ſorts of people, one of them conſiſts of unlearned ignorant men, women, &amp;c. the other ſort conſiſts of learned wiſe men after the fleſh, and theſe ſorts being divided into 2.
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:160531:11"/>equall parts for number, of the weaker ſort God will ſave many, and of the wiſer ſort he will ſave but a few in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon of the other; now when God converts one of the wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer and learnedſt, doth he not ſhew more mercy to him that he converts and calles out of the wiſer ſort of whom he will ſave but a few, then he doth ſhew to him whom he ſaves out of the ignoranteſt and weakeſt ſort of whom he ſaves many, it being many to one that he is ſaved, and compara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively; but a few to one that the other is ſaved; wherefore as thou doſt exceede other Converts in Gods mercie ſhewed in thy converſion, and in the parts a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove other converts, ſo it is the duty to exceed other converts in the love and obedience to God, as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> did who as he was a great Scolar, and a wiſe man after the fleſh and ſo of their rank of whom but a few are to be ſaved, ſo after his converſion as Gods mercie was ſhewed to him in his conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion more then to other ordinary converts, and as he excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded them in human parts and learning, ſo he did exceed them in the love and ſervice of God, we finding none like him in reſolution and labour for God. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.10. wherefore thou that art a convert of his ſort, know that thou mayſt be equall in thy love and obedience to God with converts of the other ſort in their love and obedience to God, yet if thou doſt not exceed them in it, thou art as ſhort of them in the dutie to God as thou doſt exceed them in naturall, and humane parts, learning, and mercie from God.</p>
